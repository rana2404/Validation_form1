# Validation_form1

This HTML file contains a registration form with fields for email, password, name, date of birth, telephone, and postal code. 
It uses JavaScript for client-side form validation to ensure that the user provides valid information before submitting the form. 
If all inputs are valid, an "Accepted!" alert is displayed, and the form can be submitted to the server.
